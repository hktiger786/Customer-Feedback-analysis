# Sentimental Analysis of various keywords and topics
This project is used to determine the sentiments of the tweets on a particular keyword or topic. In this project we use the tweepy library to extract the data from twitter and then based on the collected data we determined its sentiment. The library used for analysing the tweets was the NLP library of TextBlob which help in determing the polarity for the tweets and based on that value we divided them into different segments. The segments were later displayed in a pie chart format so as to determine the overall sentiment on a certain keyword or topic.
